## üìå 1. Project Introduction

This project is a comprehensive electronic system designed to manage **examinations and evaluation** processes at Zagazig University (ZU). The system aims to transform traditional assessment and review processes into an efficient and accurate digital platform.

## üéØ 2. System Core Objectives

1.  **User Management:** To support and manage the permissions of all stakeholders: students (across different degrees and levels), professors, and heads of scientific departments.
2.  **Question Bank:** To establish and maintain a centralized question bank that professors can utilize to develop exams for various courses.
3.  **Exam Management:** To link exams to specific courses and define total marks and passing scores for each exam.
4.  **Automatic Result Calculation:** To record student answers and automatically calculate scores for display of results per course.
5.  **Evaluation System:** To enable students to evaluate both the courses and the professor responsible for teaching the course.

## üíª 3. Technical and Conceptual Structure

| Component | Detail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | **ZU\_EES** (Zagazig University Examination & Evaluation System) | The adopted database name. |
| **Data Model (ERD)** | **Strong Relationships:** The model is built on 1:M and M:M relationships, using associative entities like **Answer** and **Evaluation** to resolve complex links. | **Complexity:** Ternary logic was applied within the **Answer** entity (linking Student, Exam, and Question). |
| **Technology Used** | **PostgreSQL** | We used DDL (table definition and constraints) and DML (data insertion) using PostgreSQL syntax. |
| **ERD Enhancements** | **Normalization & Generalization** | The tables are confirmed to be highly normalized (near 3NF), and the **Generalization** concept was used for user classification (Professors and Students). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Database Setup

To set up the database structure, please follow these steps:

1.  Create the database named **`ZU_EES`**.
2.  Execute the DDL scripts for table creation (respecting the table and Foreign Key dependencies).
3.  Execute the DML (`INSERT INTO`) scripts to populate the tables with data necessary for testing.

### Key System Functions Demonstrated (SQL Queries):

* Viewing the student's total results per course.
* Calculating the average evaluation for professors and courses for the Head of Department.
* Identifying the top 10 scoring students for a specific course.
* Determining the highest-evaluated professor for a given course.
